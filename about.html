			<p>With cameras on every device these days, it's hard to understand why anyone would need to have someone else come out to take pictures. The truth is, most people don't want to spend a lot of time or effort working with the camera equipment to really bring out what they see in the world. The few that do take the time and effort to see things in the camera different from everyone else are what makes the difference. 
			<p>I got into photography shortly after the birth of my daughter. I had never purchased pictures before myself(although my parents had) and what I got from the department store photography studio didn't satisfy me. I wanted the image quality to be better. It took a long time to receive the photo(yes 1 photo). I only got a physical copy. Worst of all is that during the session, I didn't get the feeling that the photographer had any passion at all. The only good thing about the experience was the fact that I got a fairly decent photo to remember my young daughter.
			<p>Afterwards, I decided I would not be going to anymore department stores and having a casual interest in photography already, it was time to take it to the next level. I began reading books and eventually aquired my first DSLR. I studied and practiced and eventually started getting a lot of awesome feedback and even requests.
			<p>I've taken an interest in photographing people mostly. I love to do weddings, all types of events, and portraits. Each person always has a unique element about them and it's always interesting to try to capture that magic in the photographic media.
